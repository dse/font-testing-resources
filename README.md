# Font Testing Resources

## Texts

-   In the `universal` directory you will find translations of the
    **United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights** into
    various languages.

-   In the `pangrams` directory you will find sentences containing at
    least one occurrence of each letter of the alphabet, e.g., "The
    quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.".

-   [The Ultimate List of Kerning Pairs](https://github.com/andre-fuchs/kerning-pairs)
    provides everything you could possibly need to find-tune your
    font's kerning.

## Specimens

-   The [Specimen Builder](https://typespecimens.xyz/builder/)
    is a tool using [Specimen Skeleton](https://github.com/kabisa/specimen-skeleton) to
    build a single-page specimen for one or more fonts.

    -   [Github](https://github.com/markboulton/specimen-builder)

## Other Tools

-   [Unicode](https://home.unicode.org/) is the _de facto_ universal
    character set, containing letters and digits in all manner of
    scripts and languages past and present, typographical symbols,
    emojis, and other graphic characters.

-   Pablo Impallari's [Font Testing Page](https://github.com/impallari/Font-Testing-Page)
    is something you can drag-and-drop your fonts into.
    
    -   **Headlines** presents a waterfall.

    -   **Text** is used to test paragraphs.

    -   **Kern** tests kerning pairs.

-   Just Another Foundry's [Text Generator](https://justanotherfoundry.com/generator)
    generates more text for testing your fonts.

    -   [Github](https://github.com/justanotherfoundry/text-generator/blob/master/kerning.txt)

-   [Shaperglot](https://googlefonts.github.io/shaperglot/) tests your font's
    language support.
    
-   Dr. Markus Kuhn's [directory](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/ucs/examples/)
    of UTF-8 text files is also useful for testing your fonts.  The most important
    is probably
    [this UTF-8 demo](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/ucs/examples/UTF-8-demo.txt).
